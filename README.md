## Overview
Wild Bunch is a (fictious) high-end florist based in Soho, central London. I wanted to create a strong visual brand for them using beautiful imagery and an upmarket feel.

I created the Wild Bunch logo to reflect the brand's values. I used a hand written font to show the brand's wild and care-free attitude, which I feel would resonate with it's customers who want that little bit of wildness in the middle of the city. I tied this with a graphic of branch to give an immediately relatable image to show that they are a flower shop. The branch is repeated across the site and serve as a logo and a section divider.

I used a subtle grey colour for the typography and spaced out the letters of the words the achieve a high-class feel.

The use of the beautiful flowers for the home and shopping pages again refects the high-end nature of the business. They are deliberately rustic in their style in keeping with the brand values.

A secondary purple colour works in harmony with the grey, and ties in with the full-screen home page image.
