## User Story
As a customer, I want to be able to buy some flowers simply and quickly.

## Overview
Wild Bunch is a (fictious) high-end florist based in Soho, central London. I wanted to create a strong visual brand for them using beautiful imagery and an upmarket feel.

I created the Wild Bunch logo to reflect the brand's values. I used a hand written font to show the brand's wild and care-free attitude, which I feel would resonate with it's customers who want that little bit of wildness in the middle of the city. I tied this with a graphic of branch to give an immediately relatable image to show that they are a flower shop. The branch is repeated across the site and serve as a logo and a section divider.

I used a subtle grey colour for the typography and spaced out the letters of the words the achieve a high-class feel.

The use of the beautiful flowers for the home and shopping pages again refects the high-end nature of the business. They are deliberately rustic in their style in keeping with the brand values.

A secondary purple colour works in harmony with the grey, and ties in with the full-screen home page image.

## UX
The user of this site is a high paid professional or someone with lots of disposable income. They want the best that money can buy, and want to impress people with it.

By having the **landing page** as a beautiful flower image, the user immediately knows that they've come to a high-quality site. By not crowding the home page with clutter, I have created a calm and peaceful feel to make them relaxed and reasured. There is minimal furniture, making it feel more luxurious. Simple use of typography that simply states what the website does, and a large tastful button invites you to start shopping. 

I wanted to make it easy for anyone coming to the site to immediately see what was for sale and with just a few clicks to purchase and have it delivered.

Clicking on the **Shop** button takes the user to a simple, clean grid of bouquets for sale. Tasteful typography under each image gives a name and a starting price for each. I created a very subtle hover over each image to show that it's been highlighed, agfain keeping the feel upmarket.

If the user is interested in one of the bouquets and wishes to discover more, then clicking on the image reveals a **modal**. This modal echoes the design of the shopping page, and has a description and a subheading asking to select from the three sizes that you would like, and a large **buy now** button to entice you. This would (if it where a live link) take you to the basket page where you would be able tp fill in your details and complete your order.

Additionally, with the **about Us** section, I wanted to introduce and show the personality of the owners and what they believe in and stand for. I feel this helps the user to relate to the sellers as people with principles and standards that they themselves would like to think they have in common. This has a images to quickly establish the links. There are also a few paragraphs about their humble beginnings and their friendship, their services to show the range of occasions they cater for and about how they are very eco minded, with all their flowers being organically sourced from a local supplier. This makes them intio real, passionate and caring people rather than just a faceless business.

We then move down to the **contact us** section. Again this is clean and uncluttered, and simply gives the address, phone number and an email. There is also an iframe of a Google Map to show their exact locaion.

Then is on the the **social buttons** linking you to their various channels. Again these have the same purple hover when the cursor moves over them tp match the other buttons.

Lastly I felt the user would benefit for a **back to top** button (in addition to the logo in the nav bar) to allow them to navigate back to the home page.
