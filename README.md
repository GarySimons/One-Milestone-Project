## User Story
As a customer, I want to be able to buy some flowers simply and quickly.

## Overview
Wild Bunch is a (fictious) high-end florist based in Soho, central London. I wanted to create a strong visual brand for them using beautiful imagery and an upmarket feel.

I created the Wild Bunch logo to reflect the brand's values. I used a hand written font to show the brand's wild and care-free attitude, which I feel would resonate with it's customers who want that little bit of wildness in the middle of the city. I tied this with a graphic of branch to give an immediately relatable image to show that they are a flower shop. The branch is repeated across the site and serve as a logo and a section divider.

I used a subtle grey colour for the typography and spaced out the letters of the words the achieve a high-class feel.

The use of the beautiful flowers for the home and shopping pages again refects the high-end nature of the business. They are deliberately rustic in their style in keeping with the brand values.

A secondary purple colour works in harmony with the grey, and ties in with the full-screen home page image.

## UX
The user of this site is a high paid professional or someone with lots of disposable income. They want the best that money can buy, and want to impress people with it.

By having the **landing page** as a beautiful flower image, the user immediately knows that they've come to a high-quality site. By not crowding the home page with clutter, I have created a calm and peaceful feel to make them relaxed and reasured. There is minimal furniture, making it feel more luxurious. Simple use of typography that simply states what the website does, and a large tastful button invites you to start shopping. 

I wanted to make it easy for anyone coming to the site to immediately see what was for sale and with just a few clicks to purchase and have it delivered.

Clicking on the **Shop** button takes the user to a simple, clean grid of bouquets for sale. Tasteful typography under each image gives a name and a starting price for each. I created a very subtle hover over each image to show that it's been highlighed, agfain keeping the feel upmarket.

If the user is interested in one of the bouquets and wishes to discover more, then clicking on the image reveals a **modal**. This modal echoes the design of the shopping page, and has a description and a subheading asking to select from the three sizes that you would like, and a large **buy now** button to entice you. This would (if it where a live link) take you to the basket page where you would be able tp fill in your details and complete your order.

Additionally, with the **about Us** section, I wanted to introduce and show the personality of the owners and what they believe in and stand for. I feel this helps the user to relate to the sellers as people with principles and standards that they themselves would like to think they have in common. This has a images to quickly establish the links. There are also a few paragraphs about their humble beginnings and their friendship, their services to show the range of occasions they cater for and about how they are very eco minded, with all their flowers being organically sourced from a local supplier. This makes them intio real, passionate and caring people rather than just a faceless business.

We then move down to the **contact us** section. Again this is clean and uncluttered, and simply gives the address, phone number and an email. There is also an iframe of a Google Map to show their exact locaion.

Then is on the the **social buttons** linking you to their various channels. Again these have the same purple hover when the cursor moves over them tp match the other buttons.

Lastly I felt the user would benefit for a **back to top** button (in addition to the logo in the nav bar) to allow them to navigate back to the home page.

## Features
### Navigation bar
This holds all the links to the sections of the site: Logo (home button), about us and aontact us. This allows the user to navigate quickly to the relevant section. The bar is set to sticky, so scolls down with the pages, making it easier to navigate, and also show the range of sections all the time.

### Home
This is the first page a user comes to, and it has to make a big impact and entice them to want to go further. I used a large beautiful image of flowers to show the type of site it is. I added a large heading telling the user that this site belongs to 'A high class florist in the heart of London', to provide a clear message of the content. There is also a large 'shop' button to take you straight to the shopping pages and get you buying with one click.

### Shopping
This shoping page has a large heading of 'Bouquets' to tell the user what's for sale, and a sub heading urging them to 'choose from any of our beautiful arrangements'. A clean, simple grid holds stylish images of the bouquets,and underneath each image is the name and a price from. A subtle hover tells the user that they have activated the image, and with a click it opens a modal. Each modal show an image of the bouquet, with a description and a selection menu to prompt them to choose from small, medium or large versions. Underneath is a large 'buy now' button for easy instant buying. This would (if it where a live link) take you to the basket page and you would be able to fill in your details and complete your order. 

Ideally this shopping page would have more bouquets, and other sections in the same style for different products including house plants, vases and other accessories. The shop button could have a drop down sub menu to link to the various sections.

### About us
This page is used to build a relationship with the user and help them feel an affinity to the owners of the site. This shows the type of people they are and what they stand for, and their personalities. This will help make the user form a bond and feel like they want to use them. It will make them into real, passionate and caring people rather than just a faceless business.

### Contact us
This section of the site is there to provide practical information to the user. It gives the address, phone number and a contact email. An iframe with a link to a Google Map of the area helps the user to see their location. The map is able to open in and be explored.

This area also holds link buttons which take the user to the various social sites that the company uses. They have a hover over them to show the user when they are activated.

### Back to top button
The logo in the navigation bar is a home button, but itâ€™s also helpful to have this button to take the user instantly back to the home page.

## Feature left to implement
I would like to add more shopping pages to the site. They would follow the same style as the bouquets page, but be selling items associated with a florist. These could be house plants, garden plants, vases, pots, gardening tools and seeds. These would be on a drop down menu from the Nav Bar.

Another idea would be a flower arranging school to be held at the shop. These would be popular for parties or just people with an interest.
